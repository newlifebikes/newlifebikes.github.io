    <h1>About The Founder</h1>
      <p1>Chase Houser is a Libertyville High School senior who had a love for bikes from a young age. He strengthened his passion even further when he trained to be a bike mechanic at Intent Bike Shop in Libertyville, going on to buy, fix, and resell used bikes during his summers. In the fall of 2021, he decided he wanted to use his skills and connections to help provide others access to bikes, resulting in his founding of New Life Bikes. The organization is dedicated solely to helping any adult in Lake County who wants a bike have access to a reliable and quality one. </p1>
